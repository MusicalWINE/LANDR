[LANDR](https://landr.com)

LANDR is a music distrobution platform and a place for samples. The main point of the repository is to install and run LANDR with WINE. 
Since it's an Electron application, it's not as easy to run. This installation script should make it easier to install and run LANDR, but you need to use the MainSetup script first as LANDR needs fonts that are installed VIA that script. Also, add a custom-made desktop entry as the one provided by WINE doesn't work that well. It just uses "wine" instead of "wineconsole" and we need it to use "wineconsole."
